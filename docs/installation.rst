Installation
============

Install git-tidy with::

    pipx install git-tidy

Verify your installation by typing ``git tidy``.

.. note::

  ``git-tidy`` is meant to be globally installed as a command-line tool so
  that one doesn't need to source a virtualenv to use it as a git extension.
  That's why we recommend installing it with
  `pipx <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx>`__. It is still fine to
  install it with ``pip``.
